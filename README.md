# API Platform Value Objects playground

This is just a test repository to explore the **Domain-Driven Design** (aka **DDD**) *Value Objects* concept using the **Symfony 4** based **API Platform** framework.

It's just a *proof of concept* that I described in a series of articles I published (links will be added soon) to show different approaches I tried dealing with this kind of *structured data* objects.

Feel free to come in touch with me and discuss these concepts more!

### How to use this playground

I added a **docker-compose** file to help you scaffold a testing environment.
It's already pre-configured so, if you want, you can just execute:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
and get a working API at http://localhost:8080
